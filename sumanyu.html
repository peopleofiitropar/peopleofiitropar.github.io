							Sumanyu Maingi : Going back 7 years in time, I clearly remember the dilemma of choosing between IIT Ropar (and a couple of other new IITs) and Punjab Engineering College (PEC) Chandigarh. The latter would let me live in Chandigarh, the best city in India and enable me to have all the fun my Dad had while studying at PEC, going to Sukhna lake for morning runs, strolling through sector 17 checking out girls or driving on the Gedi route. The former would give me the most coveted tag in India, being a part of the "IIT" brand. I went for the former, a decision influenced a lot by my family because after all, "IIT to IIT hai!!" and I must say, I am more than happy I did it.
<br><br>
The journey at IIT Ropar had been too amazing to be described in writing. It was day one and the thought of 4 people living together in one room (and 8 people sharing 1 bathroom) scared me. But I guess that was the beauty of it. Four of us belonged to different parts of India and before I knew it, I was eating home-brought Dal baati from the Rajasthani guy, teaching Hindi to the guy from Kerala and correcting the Punjabi song pronunciations of the UP guy. And this was just one room. Interacting with people from all over India, learning about their cultures, languages, food, 'bad words' etc and celebrating their festivals was a one-of-a-kind experience which changed me for good and helped me adjust on a global scale here in the US where people from pretty much every country in the world live together in harmony.
<br><br>
People who say "These 4 years are going to be the most memorable 4 years of your life" couldn't be more right. That's what I heard from my seniors when I was a freshman and I couldn't agree more. These four years are where you'll find the best of friends, learn the most important skills required in the real world, get opportunities to learn and do things you never imagined yourself doing and most importantly, have an immense amount of fun, the kind you'll rarely ever experience any time after.
<br><br>
Trying not to get too carried away, I feel that IIT Ropar brought about a huge transformation in me. From being this (kind of) introvert person in the first semester, I saw myself evolve into this hyperactive maniac who knew literally everyone's names (yes the random security guards and canteen walas too!) on campus, participated in almost all on-campus (and some off campus too!) events, tried his hands in every possible extracurricular activity and what not.
<br><br>
Currently, I work as a Materials Scientist at Nanolab Technologies in the San Francisco Bay Area, California after graduating from University of Southern California in Los Angeles.
<br><br>
For the 'gyan' I was asked to share with my juniors, there's a LOT but I'll try to be short.
<br><br>
1. Enjoy your hostel life. You won't get it back. Trust me, late night football matches, waiting in lines for bathrooms, getting freaked out by those pigeons in balconies, 15 people sitting together in one room jotting down the same assignment will become beautiful memories after you graduate. Abhi time hai, karlo maze!
<br><br>
2. Explore. The list of things you can learn and master while in college is endless. Be it playing guitar, learning a new language (coding or otherwise), learning to dance, become a photographer, participating in Inter IIT sports meets, you have plenty of time to try your hands at anything and everything that interests you. Who knows you may even end up with a career in those!!
<br><br>
3. Relation building. The bonds made in college stay for a lifetime. Even if you haven't been in touch with someone for a while, when you meet, it feels like it was yesterday that you were sipping coffee with that guy or mocking professors in classes. Open up. Get out of your room, hostel, department, batch and make friends with all sorts of people. It'll add another dimension to your personality. I am still in touch with people from batches 3 years older than me as well as 3 years younger than me.
<br><br>
4. Take initiatives. If you're the revolutionary sorts, good news. The new director is very supportive of interesting and innovative ideas, be it academic or just for fun. If you feel something is missing, document it and get it started. I know so many clubs (photography club for instance) that weren't there when I came but were there when I left.
<br><br>
5. Academics. Having said all of the above, IIT is ultimately about learning and acquiring knowledge that would help you in your life ahead. Don't think 'IIT ho gya ab to life set hai!'. It's totally your own duty and responsibility to make the most out of being in a premier institute, be it learning through online classes, spending time on your own practicing a new skill or hogging your professor's or TA's offices. No one out there will give you a job JUST BECAUSE you are an IITian. You have to prove that you're worthy. Having a decently good GPA (>8) and relevant projects/internships is always a plus if you're planning to venture into a core engineering career. Even if you're not, it's good to stay active in the field(s) of your interest and do something that you can show because even if your GPA isn't that great, your work speaks for itself. I know so many people whose GPA wasn't that great but they killed it in whatever they wanted to do.
<br><br>
I ended up being way lengthier than I had intended to and made it sound more like a rambling than a write-up! Nevertheless, this brought back sweet memories from my time at Ropar and believe me, at the end of four years, you're all gonna feel the same pain as I did while signing out of that main gate register for the last time!
<br><br>
To four great years!!!
