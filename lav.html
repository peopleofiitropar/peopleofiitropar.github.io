							IIT Ropar is the place where I first developed an interest in Computer Science and my journey into the tech world started. It has played a huge role in shaping me both as a human and as a professional. I've always considered IIT Ropar as a platform of opportunities. It provides a scope for interaction, not only with all students but also with the faculty.
<br>
I started my journey and found myself struggling, to balance between learning new things by joining various clubs and maintaining my grades. But I met some amazing friends and they helped me through it all. That's undoubtedly the best gift I've received from IIT Ropar. We had a lot of fun together, went on many trips, played together and made some of the best memories of our lifetime. We have to spend a day in and day out with our friends. So during college life, they have the most influence over us.
<br>
I was interested in management so I joined Enactus, an NPO promoting social entrepreneurship. I've had to manage projects, have meetings with important people, present before an esteemed jury and got to bring a smile to the faces of many underprivileged people. This totally changed me as a human being. I picked up many leadership traits and developed confidence.
<br>
For my development professionally, I landed 3 internships during my college period. The first two were after the 4th and 5th semesters, focusing on AI, ML and web development as well. The third one was after the 6th semester and an on-campus offer. It was the biggest opportunity that came my way, an internship in Tokyo. I got selected and worked hard. Landed a PPO and am happily working at the same company.
<br>
Now when I look back, I sometimes feel I could've done things differently. Spent some less time procrastinating and focusing more on my goals and my achievements. But that's a part and parcel of life. So I would advise everyone embarking on this journey to set a goal, keep it in mind and strive towards achieving it, having fun and doing adventurous things along the way!
