							Brief Bio- IIT Ropar Mechanical (2012-16), Internships at IISc Bangalore and California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA. 
Tata Motors Limited – Senior Manager ( 2016-2018). 
Masters in Applied Science- University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada (2018- Present)<br>

The way you think depends on the company of people you have and the environment you are raised in. This you will realize after graduating from IIT Ropar. The quality of the environment at IIT Ropar will raise you from just a JEE aspirant to a person who can think out of the box, can take any challenge and still be down to earth. During JEE preparations you are lured by the IIT tag, MNCs and the social status of being a part of elite 2% of the same age group. But joining IIT Ropar changed the very idea of it. No matter how good you are with your talent, there will someone better at the place.
<br>
When I joined IIT Ropar, considering it was just 5th year of the institute still running from the temporary campus, I had a lot of questions. But my parents always used to say -"Don't try to use the name of lIT Ropar to make your career, try to do something that lIT Ropar will use your name. That is the real IITian's way". Many have studied at IIT but the feeling of being a part of making an IIT is just incomparable. It is an era of startups, you just got one to run. Being a new IIT doesn't mean a lack of opportunities. Fact is, it's the other way round, the institute has young faculty, typically an average of around 30-35 years. The young professors are always energetic, welcoming new ideas with open arms and open for change.

Not wasting many lines I will directly get to some gyaan which is the sole purpose of this page. So I will write a few points.
<br>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
1) Complain to improve, not to give a reason to your failure- This is a common tendency amongst us. We complain of not having good infrastructure, un-interesting lectures, sports facilities and so on. We justify that we are not getting good grades because the course material is not interesting. This is life, not everything will be interesting, look for positive things. Frankly speaking, infrastructure for BTech ciricullum is more than sufficient at IIT Ropar.
<br>
2) Try to get good grades- Bad grades might hurt but good grades for sure will not. I have seen people developing an interest in MBA or MS and later regretting grades. I am not asking you to excel, but maintain decent GPA above 8.
<br>
3)Balance your extracurriculars with academic life. Someone told me in my first year- “Academics add 1and extracurriculars add 0. That will take you to 10s,100s and so on but it is just 0without1
<br>
4)Try to explore your interests. I have seen people that liked a subject and stuck to it till the very end. There is a very thin line between “What you like and what you excel”. We generally think that we like what we excel in. Giving you an example- I worked on Fluid dynamics in IISc, on nanomaterials at Caltech and IC engines for BTech thesis. Finally, I am continuing in the area of nanomaterials here in Canada.
<br>
5) Go for a research internship after 2nd year at a different place. I am saying 2nd year because it is the best time. People will not miss any opportunities of PPO. Generally, they get paid also, get to meet new people and get to know about different opportunities. Just google these opportunities regularly ( like DAAD, IAS SRF etc). Email profs in other Institutes for opportunities. You can always go for industrial ones in third year if research doesn’t work out. Otherwise it’s a win- win situation.
<br>
6) Just believe in yourself, give more than 100% and then, take risks. I still remember the time I was applying for SN Bose program. All of the seniors guided me very well, they gave critical comments for my application which really helped me a lot, but almost everyone told me in a very gentle way that the selection is next to impossible. I went to my hostel room and kept looking at that SOP and edited it continuously for 2 full days. Finally, the result came and I was going to US.
<br>
7) Involve in at least 1 extracurricular activity where you can develop your personality. I joined Enactus and I think that was the highlight of my stay. I interacted with a lot of people outside the campus, worked with both juniors and seniors. Those small-small activities will prepare you to plan, organize and manage things. No matter you want to go for MS or MBA.
<br>
8 ) Never miss DJ nights and those crazy events in hostel life. When I get a flashback I only remember that hangouts first, academics and extracurriculars next.
<br>

<br>
I don’t want to drag it down more but would like to add one more thing. Generally, people leave their MS dream as they think that it's very expensive. I would like to highlight that don’t worry about that. Come to Canada, there are many programs that are fully funded including your living expenses. If anyone is interested, you can always contact me on FB.
<br>
Finally, I would like to thank this amazing initiative of “People of IIT Ropar” page. I envy that these things didn’t exist during our time and thus we know the importance of it. Thanks, Anmol for contacting me. Continue this excellent initiative and don’t let this page die.
