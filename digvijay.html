							I am one of the students in the Pioneer Batch of IIT Ropar!!
Thoughts in this story are my own, and I am not speaking for my entire batch. So here goes...
<br>
I was battling between joining NSIT, BITS Pilani and IIT Ropar, and the usual “IIT ka brand” discussions started happening and many uncles and aunties gave advices on where I should go. I don't recall if it was my own decision or a combination of everyone else's decision that they made for me, but I joined IIT Ropar. The fact that we were going to spend the first year in IIT Delhi played a major role in this decision. My parents and I were also hoping that first year gets extended into 2 years and then 3. How cool would be that? Well, fuck no. After an amazing year at IIT Delhi, we were told to leave. Damn it, I am stuck, I thought
<br>
Imagine spending a year in Hogwarts and then entering this local community college. All my life I spent in the comfort zone of my house, pampered more than you can imagine, and here I am fighting for a fucking leg piece in the mess. Gone are the days when the leg pieces were more than double the members of my family. What am I doing with my life? For the innocent readers, I am talking about chicken xd
<br>
From the sports fields to the computer lab, we saw everything being setup in front of our eyes. All the canteens and food joints opened up in front of us. We had professors driving in from IIT Delhi to teach us. All the organizations that you guys are now a part of, all the fests, all the IIT Ropar Chapters of ABC, everything was started by some of us.
<br>
But hey, there is something called as Perspective. It's a big thing. Having different experiences in life gives you a different perspective, which helps you grow a better person, and that's what happened with me in the 3 years. Besides the painful first few months, I learnt how to be independent. I interacted with students from all over India. I got to know their culture, their food, their language, their thoughts, their jokes, their abuses, their way of studying, their way of learning and what not. I became this sponge who would just absorb everything that's thrown at it. The best thing in those 3 years was the hostel life. It is something everyone should experience at some point in their lives. IIT Ropar is a beautiful memory now. Even though it didn't start well, it ended on a high note.
<br>
Currently I am Senior Software Development Engineer at Amazon Web Services at Greater Seattle, Washington. I did my masters from Columbia University in the City of New York.
<h4 class="posttitle">Advice for Juniors</h4>
If I have to give any advice to current students, I would say the following (thoda gyan toh chalta hai yaar):
<br>
1. Stop complaining about your professors. While good professors are an asset, not-so-good professors just mean you have to work hard on your own. You heard about the Internet? Well then, use it. There is unlimited content on every topic on the internet. What is stopping you from learning? It's all in your head.
<br>
2. Do as many internships as possible. Research or industrial, that's up to you. One, it's great for your resume. Two, the same perspective bullshit I mentioned above. Three, and most importantly, you learn how the real world works.
<br>
3. Enjoy your hostel life. You won't get it back. You will cherish it for the rest of your life, not the fucking A- grade you got instead of A (don't go beyond that, B is too low:P. Kidding, I got a C in Engineering Drawing :))
<br>
4. Don't be content with your admission into IIT. There are people out there in non-IITs who get double motivated because they couldn't get through JEE, and trust me they will kick your ass professionally if you don't buck up. I am in the industry since almost 5 years, and I have worked with people from regional colleges of India, at the same level as I am, probably earning around the same. Only difference being, it took them N+1 or N+2 years to get their, instead of N for me, just because of the “IIT” branch. But who cares? 1,2 years here and there, no one care!
