							Divya Sharma : Even after 10 years, I still vividly remember April 13, 2008. The day of JEE. The day that would set the course for the rest of my life. And in retrospect, I can say for sure that I would be a very different person living a very different (and not necessarily better) life if that day had gone differently. <br>
I was only a little girl who had been extremely sheltered and protected all her life when I joined IIT Ropar.
<br>
Walking into IIT Delhi with its majestic campus was thrilling and intimidating at the same time. This was the first time I was living by myself with new wonderful people surrounding me. And I let this new found independence carry me away. I had so much fun. But, I didn't do my best academically in the first year. My confidence in myself and my abilities took a plunge.
<br><br>
Then, came the second year. Low self-confidence and a temporary campus that lacked even the most basic things. This combination ensured that the year was going to be full of struggles. And it was. But, looking back, I would not be the person I am today if it weren't for those struggles. I would still be the pampered little girl who didn't have a spine. Struggles build character. And so they did for me as well. I became stronger, learnt how to deal with less than ideal situations. I worked hard and I started getting good grades.
<br><br>
Today, I'm a senior software engineer at Microsoft in Seattle. Life is pretty damn great. I couldn't have asked for more. Not to toot my own horn, but I'm proud of the person I am today. I'm a much stronger, a much more mature person now than I was 10 years ago. I owe most of this to the time I spent at IIT Ropar with all you amazing people. I am so grateful that I joined IIT Ropar. I wouldn't change it. This college and this community have given me so much. It has given me friends for life. Thank you all for being a part of my journey. I love you all.0.
